        Discuss how using singularity in Big data could possibly
        change the way big data has been using now. Many of the
        scientists believe by 2045 singularity will hit Information
        technology and computing industry when machines would be
        similar intelligent as humans. In this paper we tried to reach
        a point with the effect of using singularity in big data
        framework where supercomputing produces more robust process
        for a revolutionary change in big data environment.

        NOSQL databases play an integral part in analyzing and
        organizing vast quantities of data.  The recent advancement of
        big data applications involve datasets which are fast
        changing, massive and diverse in nature. As innovation of big
        data progresses, next big thing comes to the world of
        development is where to store this voluminous data which is
        core of any big data application. With the evolution of NOSQL
        databases data storage problem was resolved but a new concern
        has risen sharply, the ‘Security’. In today’s world data
        governance, in form of data security plays a most imperative
        role in success of every organization.  NoSQL databases are
        designed to deliver real time performance in keeping large
        volume of data stored but while developing these databases
        security was not a primary subject rather performance,
        velocity, scalability were top of the list. This paper talks
        about the security aspect of NOSQL databases in big data
        application and how organizations can implement NOSQL
        databases considering the security and whether having these
        databases a wise decision on picking up right databases in big
        data application.

        This article focuses on the impending impact of big data
        analytics improving health, preventing and detecting illness
        at a preliminary stage of illness and personalize
        interferences.  The complexity and diversity of biological
        data are pouring the need of big data analytics and how it is
        applied in biological field especially in Pharmacogenetics,
        personalized/precision medicine. Big data is particularly very
        useful in the healthcare industry as a whole for its data
        handling intensive nature. Over the past decade, electronic
        health records (EHR) have become an extensively accepted in
        hospitals and clinics worldwide and the amount of information
        is generally daily from a single patient is increasing day by
        day. Important clinical acquaintance and a deeper
        understanding of patient disease patterns can be deliberate
        from such data. It will help to improve patient care as well
        improve efficiency of patient care and disease
        prevention. There are few applications pointed out to be
        effective using big data such as Healthcare data solutions and
        big data in cancer therapy, continuous monitoring of patients
        symptoms, healthcare intelligence, fraud prevention and
        detection. Many people heard about the proposition of
        precision medicine in State of Union speech of President Obama
        in 2012. Since then the revolutionary process of precision
        medicine started to grow rapidly in healthcare industry. On
        January 30, on the same Precision based medical initiatives,
        the Obama administration exposed facts about the Precision
        Medicine tentative plans.
