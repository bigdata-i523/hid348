    abstract: "Discuss how using singularity in Big data could possibly change the\
        \ way big data has been using now. Many of the scientists believe by 2045\
        \ singularity will hit Information technology and computing industry when\
        \ machines would be similar intelligent as humans. In this paper we tried\
        \ to reach  a point with the effect of using singularity in big data framework\
        \  where supercomputing produces more robust process for a revolutionary change\
        \ in big data environment. \n"
