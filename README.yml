        Discuss how using singularity in Big data could possibly change the
        way big data has been using now. Many of the scientists believe by 2045
        singularity will hit Information technology and computing industry when
        machines would be similar intelligent as humans. In this paper we tried
        to reach  a point with the effect of using singularity in big data framework
        where supercomputing produces more robust process for a revolutionary change
        in big data environment.
