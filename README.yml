        Discuss how using singularity in Big data could possibly
        change the way big data has been using now. Many of the
        scientists believe by 2045 singularity will hit Information
        technology and computing industry when machines would be
        similar intelligent as humans. In this paper we tried to reach
        a point with the effect of using singularity in big data
        framework where supercomputing produces more robust process
        for a revolutionary change in big data environment.

        NOSQL databases play an integral part in analyzing and
        organizing vast quantities of data.  The recent advancement of
        big data applications involve datasets which are fast
        changing, massive and diverse in nature. As innovation of big
        data progresses, next big thing comes to the world of
        development is where to store this voluminous data which is
        core of any big data application. With the evolution of NOSQL
        databases data storage problem was resolved but a new concern
        has risen sharply, the ‘Security’. In today’s world data
        governance, in form of data security plays a most imperative
        role in success of every organization.  NoSQL databases are
        designed to deliver real time performance in keeping large
        volume of data stored but while developing these databases
        security was not a primary subject rather performance,
        velocity, scalability were top of the list. This paper talks
        about the security aspect of NOSQL databases in big data
        application and how organizations can implement NOSQL
        databases considering the security and whether having these
        databases a wise decision on picking up right databases in big
        data application.
